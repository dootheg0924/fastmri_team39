# Experiment 007: FI-VarNet 6+6 with MRAugment

This experiment adds the fastMRI MRAugment profile from Fabian et al.,
*Data augmentation for deep learning based accelerated MRI reconstruction
with limited data* (ICML 2021), to experiment 006. The model, optimizer,
210,000 optimizer updates, and objective remain unchanged.

## Paper-aligned augmentation

Each transform is sampled independently with probability `p(t) * weight`.

| Transform | Weight | Sampled parameter |
|---|---:|---|
| Horizontal flip | 0.5 | n/a |
| Vertical flip | 0.5 | n/a |
| 90-degree rotation | 0.5 | k in {0, 1, 2, 3} |
| Integer translation | 1.0 | y +/-12.5% height, x +/-8% width |
| Arbitrary rotation | 0.5 | [-180 deg, 180 deg] |
| Isotropic scaling | 0.5 | [0.75, 1.25] |
| Anisotropic scaling | 0.5 | independent axes in [0.75, 1.25] |
| Shear | 1.0 | [-12.5 deg, 12.5 deg] |

Affine transforms use bicubic interpolation (`order=3`). As in the paper's
multi-coil experiments, 2x pre-upsampling is disabled. The exact same geometry
is applied to every real/imaginary coil channel, followed by FFT and masking.

The base probability uses the paper's normalized exponential schedule:

`p(t) = 0.55 * (1 - exp(-5 * t/T)) / (1 - exp(-5))`.

Because FI-VarNet stops at 210k optimizer steps rather than a fixed epoch
count, `T` is derived as `ceil(210000 / optimizer_steps_per_epoch)`. This
preserves the paper's epoch-normalized curve over the complete FI run.

## Deliberate project-specific decisions

1. The MRAugment paper's fastMRI experiment used random R8 masks with 4% ACS.
   This challenge mixes equispaced R4/R8 and its supplied ACS differs by
   acceleration. We infer R and ACS exactly from each stored mask, retain both,
   and randomize only the equispaced offset per volume and epoch. Zero-padded
   acquisition bounds are inferred from full k-space and kept unsampled, as in
   fastMRI's `padding_left`/`padding_right` mask handling.
2. The current public MRAugment repository uses torchvision bilinear affine,
   one scale, and two shear axes. Its README notes that the paper results used
   bicubic interpolation, separate isotropic/anisotropic scaling, and one
   shear. This implementation follows the paper rather than that simplified
   code path.
3. Challenge bbox labels are not part of MRAugment. Boxes are transformed with
   the same geometry and enclosed axis-aligned afterward. If a labeled lesion
   leaves the final 384x384 field or becomes smaller than 7 pixels on either
   axis, geometry is canceled for that sample; remasking is still allowed.
4. Augmentation and mask RNGs are derived from seed, epoch, filename, and
   slice (mask offset excludes slice). This is reproducible across worker
   counts and resumed runs, unlike mutable per-worker RNG state.
5. Training remains 210k optimizer updates. MRAugment studies sometimes train
   longer, but changing duration would confound the augmentation comparison.
